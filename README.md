2.	Profile matching algorithm: A profile matching algorithm will be used to match job seekers with available job listings that best fit their profile, education qualification, and skills. The algorithm will consider factors such as job seekers preferences and employer requirements to provide the most accurate job matches.
3.	User interface design: The website will have a user-friendly interface that enables job seekers to create profiles, search for jobs, and apply for job listings. Employers will also have an interface that allows them to post job listings and search for candidates.
4.	Testing and optimization: The website will be thoroughly tested to ensure the profile matching algorithm is precise and that the user interface is easy to use. The website will also be optimized to enhance performance and ensure it can manage a high volume of traffic and job listings.
